## Photoacustic Imaging with SimSonic2D
The focus of this project was the exploration of the photoacoustic imaging capabilities of the SimSonic2D software package.
This package can be found [here](http://simsonic.fr/).
See the paper we wrote for a complete understanding of what the project is about.
The reference papers are included.
